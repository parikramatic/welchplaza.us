<h2 align="center">USEFUL NOTES</h2>
<br/>

Here is a collection of pearls of wisdom from current residents that should save you some trouble in the long run

- Attending the monthly HOA board meetings is strongly recommended, even if virtual.

- Present a proposal for any home improvements to the board for approval first before committing to any work. Board approval is easily achieved provided you meet the requirements laid out in the HOA R&R.

- Our contact at Kappes Miller is Mike G*, please route any KM issues via Mike.

- The garage is shared with the Verse and has 3 entrances. NOTE: This is not a secured garage. We recommend not leaving any valuables in your vehicle overnight. There have been multiple reports of break-ins, law enforcement action is scarce and cameras do not act as sufficient deterrents.

- Pick up your packages at the Package Concierge box on P2, and instruct your package delivery person to use the box for deliveries. Packages delivered to the lobby instead of Package Concierge are at risk of theft and must be picked up promptly.

- There are more than a few ways to pay your HOA dues to KM, pick one that works for you:
  - Set up auto-pay on the KM website to withdraw funds from your checking account automatically
  - Set up auto-pay from your bank to send checks to KM every month automatically
  - Use the KM coupon-style booklet to mail them a check every month manually
  - Use the KM website to make one-time payments manually
- Contractors must use street parking:
  - 1 hour parking outside the Verse office on 22nd Ave S.
  - 2 spots on S. King and 23rd; please do not park in the fire lane
- Trash chutes are on each level, recycling is by the elevators on P1, and compost is by the Verse entrance on P1.

- Cat litter does not go into the trash chutes due to known problems with the compactor. Please dispose of cat litter in the bins next to the P1 and P2 elevator entrances.

- Our gym is on P1 and is only accessible from the garage on the P1 level, north of the elevator.

- Quiet hours are 10pm to 7am, please be courteous to your neighbors during these hours.
