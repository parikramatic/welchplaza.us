Congratulations on your new home. There's a lot to love about living at WPC. We created this site with the intent of helping new owners get settled in, and make the transition easier. Expect this page to evolve over time, as more relevant information is identified.

While the content for this page is built out, here is a checklist for reference:
- [x]  change the locks
- [x]  reach out to the board
- [x]  set up auto-payment with Kappes Miller
- [x]  review the HOA rules
- [x]  join the owners email group
