Congratulations on your new home. There's a lot to love about living at WPC. We created this site with the intent of helping new owners get settled in, and make the transition easier. Expect this page to evolve over time, as more relevant information is identified.

While the content for this page is being assembled, here is a quick checklist for reference:

- &#10004; change the locks
- &#10004; update your address with USPS
- &#10004; reach out to the board & introduce yourself
- &#10004; set up auto-payment with Kappes Miller
- &#10004; review the HOA rules
- &#10004; join the owners email group
- &#10004; ask Kappes Miller to add your name(s) to the call box
